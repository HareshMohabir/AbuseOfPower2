      Abuse Of Power
    </h1>
<p><strong>Why do people abuse their power?</strong></p>
<p>People abuse the power they have over others because they feel invincible with that power. They don’t believe there are consequences for their actions.</p>
<p><strong>How can we solve this problem?</strong></p>
<p>We can solve this problem by putting better people in charge or having better training for the job. We can also have better protocols to handle altercations.</p>
